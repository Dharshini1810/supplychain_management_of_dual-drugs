Include the JavaScript IPFS library in your HTML file by adding the following line to the <head> section:
    Copy code
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/ipfs/dist/index.min.js"></script>
    Create an instance of the IPFS object in your JavaScript code:
    Copy code
    const node = new window.Ipfs()
    Wait for the IPFS node to be ready:
    Copy code
    node.on('ready', async () => {
      // your code here
    })
    Retrieve the file from IPFS using the CID:
    Copy code
    const cid = "Qm<hash>"
    const file = await node.cat(cid)
    You can then use the file object to display the file in the browser. For example, if the file is an image, you can display it using an <img> tag:
    Copy code
    const img = document.createElement('img')
    img.src = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([file]))
    document.body.appendChild(img)
    You can also use fetch method to get the file using cid as url.
    
    Copy code
    fetch(`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${cid}`).then(response => response.blob()).then(blob => {
       // do something with the blob
    });
    Note that this is a basic example and it's better to handle error and other cases before deploying in production.
    Also, in the above example, I am using a public gateway provided by IPFS. you can set your own gateway to access the file.
    
    
    
    how should I use the blob
    Once you have retrieved a file from IPFS as a blob, you can use it in various ways depending on the type of file. Here are a few examples:
    
    If the file is an image, you can display it in an <img> tag by setting the src property to an object URL created from the blob:
    Copy code
    const img = document.createElement('img')
    img.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
    document.body.appendChild(img)
    If the file is a video, you can display it in a <video> tag by setting the src property to an object URL created from the blob:
    Copy code
    const video = document.createElement('video')
    video.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
    video.controls = true
    document.body.appendChild(video)
    If the file is audio, you can play it by setting the src property of an <audio> tag to an object URL created from the blob:
    Copy code
    const audio = document.createElement('audio')
    audio.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
    audio.controls = true
    document.body.appendChild(audio)
    If the file is a text or a document, you can read its contents by converting the blob to a text or a JSON file.
    Copy code
    const reader = new FileReader()
    reader.onload = function() {
        console.log(reader.result)
    }
    reader.readAsText(blob)
    If the file is a downloadable resource, you can prompt the user to save it to their device by creating a link and setting the href property to an object URL created from the blob, and the download attribute to the desired filename:
    Copy code
    const link = document.createElement('a')
    link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
    link.download = 'downloadable-file.txt'
    link.innerHTML = 'Download file'
    document.body.appendChild(link)
    Note that you should always revoke the object URL when you are done with it to prevent memory leaks:
    
    Copy code
    URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
    You can use the blob as per your requirement and it's better to handle error and other cases before deploying in production.
    
    
    
    blob is not defined
    I apologize for the confusion, it seems that I made a mistake in my previous response. The blob variable is not defined, it should be the variable that you used to store the result of the fetch(https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${cid}`).then(response => response.blob()).then(blob => { // do something with the blob });`
    
    So, you can use the blob variable that you have received from the fetch response to perform the operations that I have mentioned in my previous response such as displaying the image, video, audio, reading the text or document, etc.
    
    For example, if you want to display an image, you can do the following:
    
    Copy code
    const img = document.createElement('img')
    img.src = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
    document.body.appendChild(img)
    It's important to note that you should always revoke the object URL when you are done with it to prevent memory leaks:
    
    Copy code
    URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
    Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
